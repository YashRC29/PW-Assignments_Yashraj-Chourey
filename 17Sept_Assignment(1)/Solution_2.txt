HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or that cannot be easily 
typed on a keyboard. They are especially useful for displaying reserved characters and symbols on a web page. Here are five 
commonly used HTML entities:

1.`&lt; - Less Than Sign (<):
   - Represents the less than symbol ("<"). Used to display the less than sign without triggering HTML interpretation.

2. &gt; - Greater Than Sign (>):
   - Represents the greater than symbol (">"). Used to display the greater than sign without triggering HTML interpretation.

3. &amp; - Ampersand (&):
   - Represents the ampersand symbol ("&"). Used to display the ampersand without triggering HTML interpretation. This is crucial 
   for avoiding conflicts with HTML entities.

4. &quot; - Double Quotation Mark ("):
   - Represents the double quotation mark ("). Used to display double quotation marks within attributes that are already enclosed 
   in double quotation marks.

5. &copy; - Copyright Symbol (©):
   - Represents the copyright symbol ("©"). Used to display the copyright symbol on a web page.

These HTML entities ensure that special characters are correctly rendered in the browser without causing issues in HTML parsing or 
interpretation.
