The DOCTYPE (Document Type Declaration) in HTML is a declaration at the beginning of an HTML document that specifies the version
of HTML being used and defines the document's type. It helps the web browser interpret the document correctly by triggering the
appropriate rendering mode. The DOCTYPE declaration ensures that web pages are displayed consistently across different browsers.
For HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is simplified to <!DOCTYPE html>.
