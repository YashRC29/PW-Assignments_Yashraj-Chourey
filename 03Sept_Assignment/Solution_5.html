    <dl>
        <dt>Front-End</dt>
        <dd>Front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for creating the user interface and client-side functionality of web applications. They determine how the web page looks and behaves in the user's browser.</dd>

        <dt>Back-End</dt>
        <dd>The back-end tech stack includes server-side technologies like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or PHP. It handles data storage, application logic, and server management, enabling communication between the front end and databases.</dd>

        <dt>Database</dt>
        <dd>Database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite are used for storing and managing structured data. They are vital for data retrieval, storage, and organization within web applications.</dd>

        <dt>Server</dt>
        <dd>Web servers such as Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS host web applications, handling requests from users' browsers and routing them to the back-end services. They ensure the application's availability and scalability.</dd>

        <dt>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</dt>
        <dd>APIs facilitate communication and data exchange between different software components. They enable integration with external services, data retrieval, and third-party functionality.</dd>

        <dt>Version Control</dt>
        <dd>Version control systems like Git are essential for collaborative development, enabling multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. They track changes and manage code history.</dd>

        <dt>Cloud Services</dt>
        <dd>Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud provide scalable infrastructure and services for deploying, hosting, and maintaining web applications. They offer resources such as servers, storage, and databases in the cloud.</dd>
