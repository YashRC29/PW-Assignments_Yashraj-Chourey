This is a basic example of an HTML document with appropriate `<title>` and `<meta>` tags for SEO optimization. In this 
example, I've used a fictional website about healthy recipes.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <!-- Required meta tags for SEO -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
    <!-- Page Title -->
    <title>Healthy Recipes Hub - Delicious and Nutritious Meal Ideas</title>
    
    <!-- Meta Description -->
    <meta name="description" content="Discover a variety of healthy recipes for every meal. Our hub provides delicious and nutritious 
    meal ideas to support your well-being.">
    
    <!-- Additional meta tags for SEO -->
    <meta name="keywords" content="healthy recipes, nutritious meals, clean eating, cooking, wellness">
    <meta name="author" content="Your Name">

    <!-- Favicon (replace with your own favicon.ico) -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

    <!-- Add more meta tags as needed -->

    <!-- CSS files, scripts, or other head elements can be included here -->
</head>

<body>
    <!-- The content of your web page goes here -->

    <!-- Scripts and other body elements can be included here -->
</body>

</html>
```

In this example:

- The `<title>` tag provides a descriptive and concise title for the page, incorporating the main keywords related to the content of 
the website.
  
- The `<meta>` tag with the name attribute "description" contains a concise and informative meta description that summarizes the 
content of the page. This is what search engines often display in the search results.

- Additional meta tags, such as "keywords" and "author," can be included based on your specific needs.

Remember to replace the placeholder values with your actual content and adjust the meta tags based on the specific focus of your 
website. Additionally, including relevant and descriptive content within the body of your HTML page is equally important for SEO.
